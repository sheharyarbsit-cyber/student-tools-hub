    <h2>How to Calculate CGPA</h2>
    <p>
      CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) is an important academic score 
      used in schools, colleges, and universities. It represents your overall 
      academic performance across all semesters.
    </p>
    <p>
      To calculate CGPA, you need to convert your grades into grade points, 
      multiply by credit hours, and divide by total credits. Our CGPA calculator 
      makes this process quick and accurate.
